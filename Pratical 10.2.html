    <h1>How to create Website</h1>
    <p>To create a website, start by planning your site's purpose and gathering your content. Then, purchase a domain name and web hosting service to get your site online. You can either use a website builder like WordPress or Wix for an easier setup, or code it yourself using HTML and CSS if you want more control. Choose a design that matches your brand and make sure it works well on mobile devices. Before launching, test everything to ensure links work and pages load properly. Finally, publish your site, set up analytics to track visitors, and start promoting it. Regular updates and maintenance will keep your site running smoothly. The whole process can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks, depending on your approach and website complexity.<p>
