    <h2>The Dog</h2>
    <p>Dogs are domesticated mammals belonging to the Canidae family and are often referred to as "man's best friend." They are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and ability to form strong bonds with humans. Dogs come in a wide variety of breeds, each with unique characteristics and traits, ranging from size and coat type to temperament and energy levels. They serve many roles, including companionship, assistance (like guide dogs), and working roles in areas like herding, hunting, and law enforcement. Dogs are social animals and require regular exercise, mental stimulation, and training to thrive.</p>
