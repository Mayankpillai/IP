    <h2>The Lion</h2>
    <p>Lions are large, powerful mammals belonging to the Felidae family, specifically the species *Panthera leo*. Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are recognized for their majestic manes, especially in males. They are social animals that live in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a few dominant males. <br></p>
    <p>Lions primarily inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands in Africa, with a small population found in India. They are apex predators, primarily hunting large herbivores like wildebeest and zebras, often using teamwork to bring down prey. Lions are also known for their distinctive roars, which can be heard from miles away and serve to communicate within their pride. Conservation efforts are ongoing, as lion populations are threatened by habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.</p>
