        The CSS outline is a line drawn around the element's border edge, but it does not affect the element's size or layout. It is primarily used to highlight elements, often for accessibility purposes, such as focusing on a button or link when navigating with a keyboard.<br><br>
        Key things about CSS outlines:<br><br>
        
        Does Not Occupy Space: Unlike borders, outlines do not take up physical space and do not affect surrounding elements.
            Used for Highlighting: Commonly used to indicate focus, especially for interactive elements like buttons, links, and input fields.
            Independent Styling: The outline is independent of an elementâ€™s border and can have different styles, widths, and colors.
            Focus Visibility: It's a default browser behavior for accessibility, ensuring users can navigate and interact with the page using a keyboard or other assistive devices.
            Customizable: While it has default styles, it can be customized using CSS properties like outline-style, outline-width, and outline-color.
