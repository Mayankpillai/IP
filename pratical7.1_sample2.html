    <h2>The Cat</h2>
    <p>Cats are small, carnivorous mammals belonging to the Felidae family. Known for their agility, independence, and playful behavior, they have been domesticated for thousands of years. Cats are characterized by their retractable claws, keen senses, and ability to purr, which many people find comforting. They come in various breeds, each with distinct physical features and personalities. Unlike dogs, cats tend to be more solitary and can be more self-sufficient, but they also enjoy social interaction with their human companions. Cats are skilled hunters and often exhibit playful behaviors that mimic hunting. They typically require less maintenance than dogs but still need regular play, mental stimulation, and care.</p>
